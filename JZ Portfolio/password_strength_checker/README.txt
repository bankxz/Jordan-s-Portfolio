PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER [PYTHON EDITION]
 
I use customtkinter - a variant of normal tkinter and is coded in python.
This took me around an hour and a half to make, I spent majority of my time making flowcharts
planning how to make the rating system able to work. I had to abstract a lot of features that I 
had planned to get this done in time. However I do plan to add them in the future I will note them 
below if you want to see.

Features:
- The apps primary feature is to allow you to check if your password is suitable
- The app looks at the length of your password and awards you rating points based off it
- It also checks to see if there are any lowercase or uppercase letter and allocates points took
- Finally it checks if you put numbers or symbols inside which are often traits of a strong password
- Finally it rates it based off the rating number you get ranging from VERY WEAK to VERY STRONG


Future Updates:
- In the feature I will add a feature which tells people how to make their password is stronger
- In the future I will add a feature which also checks a file full of commonly used passwords
and deducts marks if yours matches
