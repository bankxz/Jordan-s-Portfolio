TO DO LIST [PYTHON EDITION]
 
I use customtkinter - a variant of normal tkinter and is coded in python.
This took me around an hour to make and required me to have intensive knowledge and apply 
computational thinking in order to make it - for example i made a flowchart to make the process a lot
more streamlined and listed out everything I needed in order to make this app before I begane making it.

Features:
- The apps primary feature is to allow you make to do list tasks
- You can claim the tasks by pressing the checkbox
- The app detects if the entry is empty and sends a warning notification
- The app also procedurally adds new tasks to the tasks frame and has a limit of around 30 tasks


Future Updates:
- In the feature I will allow people to make different folders for their todo list and switch between them
- This will allow people to add to do list tasks for different occasions.
